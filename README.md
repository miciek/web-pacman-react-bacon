# Reactive Pac-Man

A small and simple implementation of classic Pac-Man game that is based on [Reactive Snake](https://github.com/miciek/web-snake-react-bacon) implementation.

This is used as helper frontend for workshop/talk/article purposes. Main repository is
[Pac-Man multiplayer server](https://github.com/miciek/pacman-multiplayer-fp).

## Usage

Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. The game requires running [the game server](https://github.com/miciek/pacman-multiplayer-fp). To run tests, execute `npm test`.
